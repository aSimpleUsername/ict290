What works:
- Sufficient 3D Detail
- User movement with  keyboard and mouse
- Extension of bush court is modelled
- Functional and unique stairs
- Meaningful transition to game world.
- Game world is slighly modelled.

Doesn't work:
- Texture rendering issues at distance (However same issue is present
Shays world, STA travel sign next to computer labs)
- Camera looks vertically up when player spawns
